Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Make sure to find my [repositories](https://github.com/wkirgsn).

Oh and see these sharp pics for illustration purposes:
