Some capital investment experts tend to say there are two basic things that will lead to a high-performing depot:

* A risk-balanced, diversified portfolio and
* Periodic asset redeployment

The former has no definitive answer and should be adapted to each investor individually.
Generally speaking, higher-risk assets can take up a larger amount of younger money-savers' total investment since they have more time to put up for adverse market trends whereas the older generation should stick to steadier securities. For a good overview of different portfolio types see [Investopedia's guideline on popuular portfolio types](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/5-popular-portfolio-types.asp). However, diversification is comfortably achieved by passively managed funds as, for instance, ETFs, which come with large cost savings and outperform actively managed funds almost all the time - [the Economist confirms](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/06/24/fund-managers-rarely-outperform-the-market-for-long).

The second virtue for a successful investment into stocks on the other hand is dead simple:
Reassess your capital as often as you feel comfortable with, at least once a year or as soon as your asset weightings fall apart drastically, say 5% in one asset weighting.

# What is Asset Redeployment?
Reassessing capital means one would transfer money on all her/his different assets in such a way, that each asset holds an amount equal to the weighting you initially assigned to it.

Imagine for example you like 30% of your capital in stocks and the other 70% in bonds since that is a risk-apportionment you can live with.
The next day stock market booms and you see your stock capital soaring up to undreamed heights.
The first moment you jump for joy but the next you halt as one glance on the new capital weights makes you shiver: stocks and bonds are fifty-fifty.
Your risk-portfolio is suddenly highly imbalanced and you are burning for action, there is a money transfer necessary.
You go ahead and deposit the required amount on your bond asset.

# Nothing simpler than that!
But hold on!
I don't have two assets, I have five or six!
Besides that, I don't place high figures at once on my portfolio, I do small monthly payments.

Calculating five amounts necessary for 5 different assets that change in different directions is non-trivial and gave me headaches in the beginning.
Very soon it became clear, that it must be solved iteratively through an algorithm.
