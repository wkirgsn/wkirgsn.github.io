* Use openai Gym Wrappers for modifying existing gym repos. For example, make the acrobot an env where the links need to point straight upwards in standstill.
* SARSA and Q Learning Algorithm, quantization to make it work for more environments.
* DQN from scratch (keras base) for acrobot
* Use LSTM/GRUs for timeseries estimation. Showcase an example with pmsm data. Showcase DataGenerator. What to look for when having several records of different lengths?
* Resampling, how does it work with pandas.
* Use own RNN Cells in keras, utilize them for integration and other highly innovative research attempts.
* Webscraper for Playstation store (or any other website)
