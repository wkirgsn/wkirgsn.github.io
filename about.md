Hi, my name is *{{site.author.name}}*.

![This is me in Japan](/assets/images/Kyoto_ProfilePic_small.jpg)

I am a german SW Dev living close to Frankfurt with a passion for Machine Learning and everything Data Science related.
Utlizing the tools and concepts one needs to delve into these exciting topics I encounter numerous tweaks and hacks I wished I'd have found earlier.

With this blog I'd like to share my experience.
